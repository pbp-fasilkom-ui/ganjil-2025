## Assignment Description

In this assignment you are going to implement *authentication*, *session*, and *cookies*, as well as several concepts learned in the tutorial.

Checklists for this assignment are:

- [ ] Implement the register, login, and logout functions so that the user can access the application freely.
- [ ] make **two** user accounts with **three** *dummy data* each, using the model made in the application beforehand so that each data can be accessed by each account **locally**.
- [ ] Connect the models `Product` and `User`.
- [ ] Display *logged in* user details such as *username* and apply `cookies` like `last login` to the application's main page.
- [ ] Answer the following questions in `README.md` in the root folder. (Modify your `README.md` that you have already created; add a subtitle for each assignment).

    - [ ] What is a `UserCreationForm`, explain its advantages and disadvantages?
    - [ ] What is the difference between authentication and authorization in Django, why are both important?
    - [ ] What are *cookies* in web development, and how do Django use *cookies* to manage user sessions?
    - [ ] Are the use of *cookies* safe by *default* in web development, or are there risks that needs to be noted?
    - [ ] Explain how did you implement the checklist *step-by-step* (apart from following the tutorial).
- [ ] Perform `add`-`commit`-`push` to GitHub.

## Deadline

The deadline for Assignment 4 is **Wednesday, 25th September, 2024, at 12:00 p.m.**
