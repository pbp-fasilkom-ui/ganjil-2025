## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will implement a web design based on several things you have learned during the tutorial (CSS, Framework, etc.).

The checklist for this assignment is as follows:
- [ ] Implement functions to delete and edit products.
- [ ] Customize the design of the HTML templates that have been created in previous assignments using CSS or a CSS framework (such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma) with the following conditions:
    - [ ] Customize the login, register, and add product pages to be as attractive as possible.
    - [ ] Customize the product list page to be more attractive and responsive. Then, consider the following conditions:
        - [ ] If there are no products saved in the application, the product list page will display an image and a message that no products are registered.
        - [ ] If there are products saved, the product list page will display details of each product using cards (**must not be exactly the same as the design in the Tutorial!**).
    - [ ] For each product card, create two buttons to edit and delete the product on that card!
    - [ ] Create a navigation bar (navbar) for the features in the application that is responsive to different device sizes, especially mobile and desktop.
        - Example of a responsive navbar (**Does not need to be exactly the same!**):
            - Navbar condition for mobile version:
            ![Example of Mobile Navbar Display](/img/4-tampilan-navbar-mobile.png)
            When the hamburger button is clicked:
            ![Example of Mobile Navbar Display (Expanded)](/img/4-tampilan-navbar-mobile-expanded.png)

            - Navbar condition for desktop version:
            ![Example of Desktop Navbar Display](/img/4-tampilan-navbar-desktop.png)

- [ ] Answer the following questions in `README.md` in the root folder (please modify the `README.md` you have created before; add subheadings for each assignment).
    - [ ] If there are multiple CSS selectors for an HTML element, explain the priority order of these CSS selectors!
    - [ ] Why does responsive design become an important concept in web application development? Give examples of applications that have and have not implemented responsive design!
    - [ ] Explain the differences between margin, border, and padding, and how to implement these three things!
    - [ ] Explain the concepts of flex box and grid layout along with their uses!
    - [ ] Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial)!
- [ ] Perform `add`-`commit`-`push` to GitHub.
