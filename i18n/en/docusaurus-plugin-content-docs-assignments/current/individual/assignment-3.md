# Assignment 3: Forms and Data Delivery Implementation in Django

Platform-Based Programming (CSGE602022) â€” Organized by the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia, Odd Semester 2024/2025

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you have to implement the data delivery concept and apply several concepts learned in the tutorial.

Checklists for this assignment are:

- [ ] Create a `form` input to add a model object to the previous app.
- [ ] Add 4 `views` to view the added objects in XML, JSON, XML by ID, and JSON by ID formats.
- [ ] Create URL routing for each of the views added in point 2.
- [ ] Answer the following questions in `README.md` in the root folder.
     - [ ] Explain why we need data delivery in implementing a platform.
     - [ ] In your opinion, which is better, XML or JSON? Why is JSON more popular than XML?
     - [ ] Explain the functional usage of `is_valid()` method in Django forms. Also explain why we need the method in forms.
     - [ ] Why do we need `csrf_token` when creating a form in Django? What could happen if we did not use `csrf_token` on a Django form? How could this be leveraged by an attacker?
     - [ ] Explain how you implemented the *checklist* above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial).
- [ ] Access the four URLs in point 2 using Postman, take screenshots of the results in Postman, and add them to `README.md`.
- [ ] Perform `add`-`commit`-`push` to GitHub.

## Deadline

The deadline for Assignment 3 is **Wednesday, 18th September, 2024, at 12:00 p.m.**

We will check the last commit of the lab assignment repository, so you do not need to submit the repository link separately.
