# Final Project

**Creating a Mobile Application using Flutter Framework (Group Project)**

---

## Specific Learning Objectives

1. Implementing a simple mobile application using the Flutter framework
2. Applying widgets for layout and input, event handling, and asynchronous communication with web services
3. Deploying the application to the cloud platform and mobile device

## General Rules for Group Assignment

1. Each group creates one GitHub repository used by all group members to collaborate. Submit the GitHub repository link to SCELE.
2. GitHub repository contains `README.md` with:
    - List of group member names
    - Link to the APK (not required at Stage I. The APK link can be added to `README.md` after completing Stage II.)
    - Application description (name and purpose of the application)
    - List of modules implemented and the division of work among group members
    - Roles or actors of the user application
    - Integration with the web service to connect to the web application created in the midterm project
3. Deployment of the application:
    - Upload the APK as a release on the GitHub repository and the cloud platform, such as Microsoft App Center or Firebase App Distribution
    - Use the logo of the your group's application

## Specific Rules per Group Member (Implementing a Module)

1. Apply widgets for layout and input (Material/Cupertino, according to the integration of the group members)
2. Apply event handling
3. Apply asynchronous communication with the web service Django (web application created in the first semester project)
4. Processing of the response JSON from the web service Django and displaying the result on the mobile application
