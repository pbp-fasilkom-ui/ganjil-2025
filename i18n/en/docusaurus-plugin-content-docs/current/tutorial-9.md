## Introduction to CI/CD

CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, is an important concept in software development related to GitHub Actions. This concept provides ways to automate and improve quality and speed in software development.

Continuous Integration (CI) focuses on continuously merging (integrating) code changes into a shared repository by team members. When a developer makes changes to code and submits it to the repository (like we do with GitHub), the CI system will automatically run a series of tests and verifications to ensure that the changes don't break or interfere with existing functionality. In other words, CI helps identify problems earlier in the development cycle.

Continuous Deployment (CD), in turn, involves automation to deploy code changes that have passed the CI process to production or testing environments. When code changes are declared safe after going through a series of CI tests, CD allows deploying these changes automatically to servers or other environments without manual intervention. This helps speed up the development process and improves responsiveness to changing business needs.

When we use GitHub Actions in CI/CD, every time there are changes to the repository, GitHub Actions can trigger CI workflows to run tests and verification. If everything succeeds, the CD workflow can be activated to release these changes to production or testing environments.

By using CI/CD, development teams can ensure that changes made don't break application quality or performance. This also speeds up product release time and improves efficiency in overall software lifecycle management.

## Introduction to GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature provided by GitHub that enables automation in the software development cycle. In other words, GitHub Actions allows us to create and customize automated workflows to perform certain tasks every time there are changes to a GitHub repository.

These workflows can be set up to run various automated actions or scripts, such as testing, building applications, or releasing new versions. The goal is to help development teams automate these processes so they can focus on writing code and developing features without worrying too much about administrative steps.

For example, when there are code changes in a GitHub repository, GitHub Actions can automatically run workflows that you've specified. These workflows can include steps like testing whether the changes don't break existing functionality, building new applications, and even releasing new versions if needed.

It's important to note that GitHub Actions uses special configuration files (usually named `.github/workflows/file-name.yml`) in the repository. This file contains descriptions of the steps that GitHub Actions should execute.

With GitHub Actions, collaboration in software development can become more efficient because many tasks can be automated. This provides additional flexibility for developers and teams to customize their workflows according to project needs.

Here's an example of a simple workflow we can use to build and test JavaScript application code using the Yarn package manager:

```yaml
name: Build and test

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: yarn install
    - name: Build
      run: yarn build

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 16
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: yarn install
    - name: Run tests
      run: yarn test
```

## Introduction to Microsoft App Center

Microsoft App Center is a cloud service that provides various features to facilitate the build, test, release, and monitoring of applications. This service can be used for various platforms, such as Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and others. In this tutorial, we will use this service to automatically build and release Flutter applications.

Microsoft App Center provides many great features for free such as continuous integration, UI testing, continuous delivery, detailed crash and error reports from applications showing how the error logs, and Analytics features. This time, we won't use all available features because Flutter is not yet officially supported by App Center. Currently, the languages and frameworks that are officially supported are Kotlin, Java, React Native, Xamarin, and Unity. In this tutorial, we will focus only on building and releasing applications on App Center. For more details, you can read the [App Center documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/).

## Tutorial: Basic Configuration in App Center

In this tutorial, you will deploy the Flutter application you created in previous tutorials to App Center. Here are the initial steps in the application deployment process:

1. Create an account on [App Center](https://appcenter.ms/) using your GitHub account (top button).

    ![Microsoft App Center Registration Page](/img/9-register.png)

2. After successfully creating an account and signing in, create a new organization by accessing the _Add new_ -> _Add new organization_ menu. Fill in the organization name you want.

    ![Add Organization Guide](/img/9-add-new.png)

3. Create a new app slot by pressing the `Add app` button.

    ![Add App Guide](/img/9-add-app.png)

4. Fill the application name with `Mental Health Tracker`. You do not need to select a release type. Choose `Android` as the OS and `Java / Kotlin` as the platform. Then, click "Add new app".

    ![App Registration](/img/9-add-new-app-name.png)

5. Open the _Distribute_ menu and open the _Groups_ menu.

    ![Groups Page Guide](/img/9-distribute-groups.png)

6. Create a new group by pressing the "Add Group" button. Name it `Public` and provide public access by changing the toggle on `Allow public access`. Press the `Create Group` button to create a new group. We do this so that the APK later created by App Center can be accessed publicly.

    ![Creating Public Group](/img/9-add-group.png)

If you're using an organization to organize your project code, follow these additional steps:

1. Open the [Authorized OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/applications) site with the account registered in the organization that owns the project code.

2. Click `App Center`.

3. Find the organization that owns your project code, then click the `Grant` button to give App Center access to the organization.

At this point, you have completed the basic setup in App Center. Next, you will set up scripts and signing for the Flutter application.

## Tutorial: Basic Flutter Application Signing Configuration

To publish the application on App Center, the Flutter application must be signed using a key to guarantee its authenticity. Therefore, we will create a key for the application and set up automation so that CI/CD scripts (both on GitHub Actions and App Center) can run smoothly.

1. Create a keystore.

    For Mac OS or Linux users, run the following command in the Terminal:

    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/release-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release
    ```

    For Windows users, run the following command in Command Prompt:

    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore %userprofile%\release-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release
    ```

    Provide a secure password for the keystore and save or remember this password, don't forget it. Fill in the required information until the process is complete. Then, **move this file to the project's root folder**.

    The command you just ran is useful for storing the keystore file named `release-keystore.jks` in your home directory with the alias `release`.

    :::note
    If Terminal or Command Prompt does not recognize the `keytool` command, please follow the additional guide on the [official Flutter web page under _Create an upload keystore_](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#create-an-upload-keystore) to add the `keytool` command to your environment path.
    :::

2. Add the following syntax to the `.gitignore` file in the project's root folder so that the keystore is not counted as a file in the Git repository. This is done because the keystore is a confidential file that needs to be protected like an account password.

    ```yaml
    # Remember to never publicly share your keystore.
    # See https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#reference-the-keystore-from-the-app
    *.keystore
    *.jks
    ```

3. Open the file `/android/app/build.gradle` and find the `buildTypes` section.

    ```gradle
    buildTypes {
            release {
                // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
                // Signing with the debug keys for now,
                // so `flutter run --release` works.
                signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
            }
    }
    ```

    Change this section to the following:

    ```gradle
    signingConfigs {
            release {
                    storeFile file("../../release-keystore.jks")
                    storePassword = "$System.env.KEY_PASSWORD"
                    keyAlias = "release"
                    keyPassword = "$System.env.KEY_PASSWORD"
            }
    }
        buildTypes {
            release {
                signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            }
    }
    ```

At this point, you have completed the basic configuration for application signing. Next, you will modify the GitHub Actions script and create a new script to build the application on App Center.

## Tutorial: Creating GitHub Actions Scripts

1. Generate a base64 string representing the keystore file that we will store as an environment variable later.

    For Mac OS or Linux users, run the `openssl base64 -in release-keystore.jks` command in the Terminal at the root folder to generate a base64 string. Save the generated string temporarily.

    For Windows users, open the project root folder in File Explorer. Then right-click, click "Show more options", and then click "Git Bash here". A Git Bash terminal will open.

    [Image descriptions of Git Bash process]

    In the terminal, run the command `openssl base64 -in release-keystore.jks`. This command will generate a base64 string. Save the generated string temporarily.

    Here's an example of the result of running this command.

    [Image of base64 output]

2. Create repository secrets in the GitHub repository with the following specifications:

    i. `GH_TOKEN` contains a GitHub (Personal Access) Token from the repository admin for automated release purposes.

    If you are the repository admin, access [this page](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) to create a Personal Access Token. Give your token a unique name. Under "Repository access", choose "Only select repositories" and select your Flutter project repository. Open the "Repository permissions" section, and grant at least read-only access to the following permissions:

    - Secrets

    Grant read and write access to at least the following permissions:

    - Actions
    - Workflows
    - Contents

    Copy the generated Personal Access Token and save it elsewhere, as you won't be able to see this token again through GitHub. Then, fill the `GH_TOKEN` repository secret with the Personal Access Token you copied.

    ii. `KEY_JKS` contains the `base64` string from the keystore file you created earlier.

    iii. `KEY_PASSWORD` contains the password you used when creating the keystore file.

    Finally, your repository secrets page will look like this.

    [Image of GitHub Secrets page]

3. If it doesn't exist already, create a `.github/workflows` folder in the application's root folder.

4. Create three new files in the `.github/workflows` folder with the following specifications:

    :::note
    **Assumed** that the `staging` branch is used to contain application code before release and the `main` branch is used for code release.
    :::
	
    i. `staging.yml`; functions to check if the codebase on the `staging` branch is free of errors when running `flutter analyze`. This script is only triggered when there's a commit on the `staging` branch.

    ```yaml
    name: Staging

    # Controls when the workflow will run
    on:
     # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the develop branch
      push:
        branches: [staging]
      pull_request:
        branches: [staging]

    # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
    jobs:
      # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
      build:
        name: Analyze
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout the code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Setup Java
            uses: actions/setup-java@v3
            with:
              distribution: "zulu"
              java-version: "17"

          - name: Setup Flutter
            uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
            with:
              channel: "stable"

          - name: Get packages
            run: flutter pub get

          - name: Analyze
            run: flutter analyze
    ```

    ii. `pre-release.yml`; functions to check if the application build process can run without errors. If there are no errors, the APK file can be accessed as an artifact. This script is only triggered when there's a pull request from the `staging` branch to the `main` branch.

    ```yaml
    name: Pre-Release

    # Controls when the workflow will run
    on:
      # Triggers the workflow on pull request events but only for the main branch
      pull_request:
        branches: [main]

    # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
    jobs:
      # This workflow contains a single job called "Build and Pre-Release APK"
      releases:
        name: Build and Pre-Release APK
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout the code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Setup Java
            uses: actions/setup-java@v3
            with:
              distribution: "zulu"
              java-version: "17"

          - name: Setup Flutter
            uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
            with:
              channel: "stable"

          - name: Get packages
            run: flutter pub get

          - name: Generate Java keystore
            env:
              KEY_JKS: ${{ secrets.KEY_JKS }}
            run: echo "$KEY_JKS" | base64 --decode > release-keystore.jks

          - name: Build APK
            env:
              KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEY_PASSWORD }}
            run: flutter build apk --split-per-abi

          - name: Pre-release APK by uploading it to Artifacts
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
            with:
              name: APKS
              path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/*.apk
    ```

    iii. `release.yml`; functions to build the application and release it as a GitHub Release. This script is only triggered when there's a commit on the `main` branch.

    ```yaml
    # This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
    name: Release

    # Controls when the workflow will run
    on:
     # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the main branch
      push:
        branches: [main]

    # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
    jobs:
      # This workflow contains a single job called "Build and Release APK"
      releases:
        name: Build and Release APK
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout the code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Get version from pubspec.yaml
            id: version
            run: echo "::set-output name=version::$(grep "version:" pubspec.yaml | cut -c10-)"

          - name: Setup Java
            uses: actions/setup-java@v3
            with:
              distribution: "zulu"
              java-version: "17"

          - name: Setup Flutter
            uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
            with:
              channel: "stable"

          - name: Get packages
            run: flutter pub get

          - name: Generate Java keystore
            env:
              KEY_JKS: ${{ secrets.KEY_JKS }}
            run: echo "$KEY_JKS" | base64 --decode > release-keystore.jks

          - name: Build APK
            env:
              KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEY_PASSWORD }}
            run: flutter build apk --split-per-abi

          - name: Get current date
            id: date
            run: echo "::set-output name=date::$(TZ='Asia/Jakarta' date +'%A %d-%m-%Y %T WIB')"

          - name: Release APK
            uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
            with:
              allowUpdates: true
              artifacts: "build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/*.apk"
              body: "Published at ${{ steps.date.outputs.date }}"
              name: "v${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}"
              token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
              tag: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    ```

5. Save these three files and push them to the repository. Check if the application is successfully built and released automatically by GitHub Actions.

If your application is successfully created and automatically released, then congratulations! At this point, we have completed the workflow on GitHub. Next, we will create a new script for building on App Center and configure the application further on the App Center website.

## Tutorial: Adding CI/CD Scripts for App Center

In this section, we will add continuous integration and continuous delivery scripts to the Flutter application repository so that App Center can automatically build and generate the application's APK file.

1. Open the `/android/app` folder.

2. Create a new file named `appcenter-post-clone.sh` and fill the file with the following code:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Place this script in project/android/app/

    cd ..

    # fail if any command fails
    set -e
    # debug log
    set -x

    cd ..
    git clone -b beta https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
    export PATH=`pwd`/flutter/bin:$PATH

    flutter channel stable
    flutter doctor

    echo "Installed flutter to `pwd`/flutter"

    # export keystore for release
    echo "$KEY_JKS" | base64 --decode > release-keystore.jks

    # build APK
    # if you get "Execution failed for task ':app:lintVitalRelease'." error, uncomment next two lines
    # flutter build apk --debug
    # flutter build apk --profile
    flutter build apk --release

    # copy the APK where AppCenter will find it
    mkdir -p android/app/build/outputs/apk/; mv build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk $_
    ```

3. Open the `/android/.gitignore` file and change it to the following. This is done so that App Center can detect the application as an Android application.

    ```yaml
    # add comment for app center
    # gradle-wrapper.jar
    # /gradlew
    # /gradlew.bat
    /.gradle
    /captures/
    /local.properties
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java

    # Remember to never publicly share your keystore.
    # See https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#reference-the-keystore-from-the-app
    key.properties
    **/*.keystore
    **/*.jks
    ```

4. Save the file and push it to the repository. Ensure that this script and the new `.gitignore` have been pushed to the `main` branch.

5. Make sure the files `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, and `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` in the `android/` directory have also been pushed to GitHub. This is important so that Microsoft App Center can recognize your repository as a Flutter project.

After creating the script, we will configure the application in App Center to be automatically built and released.

## Tutorial: Advanced Configuration in App Center

1. Open the App Center website and open the application project.

2. Open the `Build` menu and select GitHub as the repository service provider. Choose the application repository for your group project.

    ![Build Menu](/img/9-build-github.png)

3. Open your main branch (`main` or `master`, adjust as needed) and click the `Configure build` button.

    ![Configure](/img/9-configure-build.png)

4. Follow these settings:

    - Enable Environment variables
    - Fill with the following name and value:
        - `JAVA_HOME`: `$(JAVA_HOME_17_X64)`
        - `KEY_JKS`: `<base64 of your keystore>`
        - `KEY_PASSWORD`: `<password of your keystore>`
    - Check `Sign builds`, and within it, check `My Gradle settings are entirely set to handle signing automatically`.
    - Check `Distribute builds` and the `Groups` radio button. Check the `Contributors` and `Public` groups in the dropdown menu.
    - Check `Build status badge`.

    ![Environment variables & Sign builds](/img/9-config-1.png)
    ![Distribute builds & Build status badge](/img/9-config-2.png)

    Notes:
    - Don't forget to replace `KEY_JKS` and `KEY_PASSWORD` with the actual values.
    - Don't forget to create a `Public` group for public application distribution.
    - Copy the build badge link in `Markdown` format and paste it into your `README.md`.

    ![Additional step 4_4](https://i.ibb.co/LvpM03f/advance.png)

    ![Additional step 4_5](https://i.ibb.co/xfpKLDh/develop.png)

5. Click the `Save & Build` button to save the configuration and start the first build process.

    You can check the public link for application publication in App Center through the _Distribute_ -> _Groups_ -> _Public_ menu. You can also copy the public link from the application publication.

    ![Distribute Link](/img/9-distribute.png)

6. Copy the public link from the application publication and paste it into `README.md`
